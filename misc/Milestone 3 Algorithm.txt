Milestone 3 Algorithm
---------------------

Take the closed list from the forward search
Start at the end of the closed list (i.e. the goal node) and add to the pathList
do
    Find a node that has 1 less distance travelled than the current node and is neighbouring the current node
    Swap to that node and add it to the pathList
until distance travelled of the current node is 0
Reverse the list and send it back

Alt algorithm
----------------
Take the closed list from the forward search
Start at the end of the closed list (i.e. the goal node) and add to the pathList
do
    Find the shortest distance travelled out of all the nodes neighbouring the current node
    Swap to that node and add it to the pathList
until distance travelled of the current node is 0
Reverse the list and send it back
